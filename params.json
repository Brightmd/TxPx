{"name":"TxPx","tagline":"Robust process management and communication, for Twisted","body":"### Robust Process Management\r\nTxPx is a system for spawning and killing processes from a Twisted application server. It handles such details as:\r\n- Wrapping a long-running process' lifetime in a deferred without losing the ability to communicate with it in realtime\r\n- Logging output to a console, or an I/O stream connected to a parent process\r\n- Simultaneously communicating with a parent process while outputting stderr to a log\r\n- Building either byte-by-byte or line-buffered protocols without losing the benefits of separate I/O streams\r\n- Keeping a list of child processes running with an easy way to terminate them when needed\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/Brightmd/TxPx.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreated by @BrightMD.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
